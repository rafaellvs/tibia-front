# tibia-front
react app to consume from [tibia-api](https://github.com/rafaellvs/tibia-api)



### overview
React app that consumes data from tibia-api. Composed (for now) of a navbar with links to existing entities in database. The pages contain a Table that shows each result coming from request.

### run locally
run `yarn`

run `yarn start`

### notes


#### toFix:
`AccordionCell` performs very badly on big pages (like creatures and bosses)

`Template` is responsible for throwing 404s
